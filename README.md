# IFS Cloud Training Page

## ðŸ“– Overview
The **IFS Cloud Training Page** is an iframed page in MyBarnhart that displays quick-link cards to various IFS Cloud role-based training courses. This page allows us to consolidate the training courses into one page and display how we want.

## Challenges
Because this is an iframed page, we have to be mindful of the exact url that users access it with (mybarnhart.com, www.mybarnhart.com, barnhart.docebosaas.com). The links we provide may cause issues with user SSO tokens being passed along, even though all domains are allowed in the system.
